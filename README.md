# -NLP - Neural Language Model

A language model predicts the next word in a sequence based off the words that have come before it in the sequence. It's possible to develop language models at the character level using neural networks.

The benefit of character-based language models is their small vocabulary and adaptability with words, punctuation, and other documents. The trade off is that, larger models are slower to train.

However, with neural language models, character-based models offer promise for a general, flexible and powerful approach to language modeling.

Here, this project is meant to be an excerise in implementing a Neural Language Models with a simple nusery rhyme and song lyrics.

What resulted were two models that could predict, with a given input of strings, predict the next sequence of strings thereafter associated with the input.
